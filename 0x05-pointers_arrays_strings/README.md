Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    What are pointers and how to use them
    What are arrays and how to use them
    What are the differences between pointers and arrays
    How to use strings and how to manipulate them
    Scope of variables

Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
    You are allowed to use _putchar
    You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file

More Info

You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, arrays of structures, malloc and free - yet.
